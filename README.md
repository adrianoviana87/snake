Snake
===========

We will use classic game programming patterns in order to create a snake implementation that is agnostic of how its graphics, sounds and inputs are really implemented.

The first result will be quite simple, just a console rendering, but in the future we will implement more sofisticated output using Unity3D.

--------

## Boundaries
* Graphic agnostic
* Sound agnostic
* Input agnostic
* Use of classic game programming patterns (http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com)
* Follow the SOLID principles
