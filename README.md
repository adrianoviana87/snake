Snake
===========

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4ixai1j2xs9pn90q/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/giacomelli/snake-mg07x/branch/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/giacomelli/snake/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/adrianoviana87/snake?branch=master)

We will use classic game programming patterns in order to create a snake implementation that is agnostic of how its graphics, sounds and inputs are really implemented.

The first result will be quite simple, just a console rendering, but in the future we will implement more sofisticated output using Unity3D.

--------

## Boundaries
* Graphic agnostic
* Sound agnostic
